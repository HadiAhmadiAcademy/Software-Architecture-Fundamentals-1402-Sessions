# Session 04

* Consider faults as incidents
* Why fault matter? It affects operational quality attributes
* Why coupling/cohesion matter? It affects structural quality attributes
* Static code analysis -> NDepend
* Categorization of Fault
    * Nature
        * Accident
        * Intentional -> meaning there is a reson behind it
    * Cause
        * Physical
        * Human
    * Boundry -> can determine whether it can be controlled or not
        * Internal
        * External
    * Phase of creation
        * Design
        * Operation
    * Persistance -> whether it needs intervention or not
        * Permanent
        * temporary
* Physical faults categorizations
* Design faults categorizations
* Deliberation of a few quality attributes
    * Availability
    * Reliability
    * Safety
* Categorization of Failures
    * Minor
    * Major
    * Critical
    * Catestrophic
* Resiliency
    * Background
    * Definition
    * Approach
    * Stages
        * Recognize
        * Isolate -> to reduce impact
        * protect -> preventing propagation of faults
        * Protect
        * Mitigate
        * Rsolve
